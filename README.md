# FinancialModels

This repo is essentially an amalgamation of a view stock trading models I decided to test out, as well as a simple backtesting framework that I made before I migrated to using backtrader. Each folder gives a rough idea of the type of algorithms being implemented, and each file name should be a good enough description. A lot of the DeepLearning models were generated by ChatGPT because I wanted to test them out quickly, rather than re-implementing the same-ish models over and over again, but the first few were implemented by me.

Surprisingly, the best model was one of the simplest ones I decided to make, and it's the one located in [MachineLearing/testing_sim_ann_iter.py](https://github.com/Summma/FinancialModels/blob/main/MachineLearning/testing_sim_ann_iter.py). It outperformed all the other models via the eyeball test, and produced the most profitable results beginning trading from January 1st, 2022. All the deep learning models, unfortunately, performed very badly and ended up consistently converging onto a "buy-and-hold" strategy.
